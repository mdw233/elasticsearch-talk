	"review": "This location is a mess. They rarely have more than one staffed cashier so you're left using the self-checkout machines. Not a big deal normally, except that the self-checkout machines here don't accept CVS Extrabucks coupons or CVS gift cards that are barcoded. I couldn't redeem an Extrabucks coupon here a year ago (even the person assiged to assist people with using the machines couldn't get it to work). At the time I thought that perhaps the machines were new and they just needed to work out the kinks. Nope-- I tried to use an Extrabucks coupon today and the machine said it wasn't accepted. Unbelievable.  If you need something,  suggest that you walk the 3 blocks down Forbes to one of TWO Rite Aids before going to this CVS location. Or catch a bus to the CVS on Centre Ave. Just don't go here; you've been warned.",
