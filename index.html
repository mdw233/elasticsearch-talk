        <p>Exposed via easy to use RestApi</p>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
                * real time: the data is stored, indexed, and available in real time ... large data sets can be queried with incredible speed
                * distributed: elasticsearch is dead simple to cluster; you can install many nodes, give them all the same cluster name, and they will discover eachother
                * this is useful for large datasets - searches can be spread amongst the nodes to share in the processing of data
                * it's also useful for keeping the engine highly available
                * search and analytics engine: it's built for searching and analytics

                    * for illustration purposes let's say there is another review that looks like this
                    * well then these are both stored in the same inverted index which looks like this
                    * you can see that each word is stored separately -- along with the document(s) it is stored in
                    * say I search for the word SELL
                        * it will find that it is in one document and return that document
                        * it didn't have to search through all of the text in the review, just the inverted index
                    * or I search for THEY FINE
                        * it will find that one word is in doc 1 / the other in doc 2
                        * so it will return 2 docs
                    * one thing I don't show here is that it actually stores the position in the string
                        * this is necessary for searching for whole phrases like you might when searching w/ quotes

                        * what I showed you - splitting on punctuation and lowercasing is just one method - default - but just one
                    * mapping: telling your index what to expect from the data instead of just guessing
                    * synonyms: you can train ES and tell it what words are actually other words
                        * developer: coder, engineer, tech
                    * stemming: part of analysis actually - breaks words down to their stem
                        * foxes becomes fox
                    * relationships:
                        * nested: a type within another type - all within one document
                        * parent/child: one document can be a child to another - but they're two separate docs that can be updated independently
